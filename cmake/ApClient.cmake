# ApClient.cmake - header-only Archipelago client deps via FetchContent.
#
# apclientpp -> wswrap -> websocketpp form the Archipelago net stack. All three
# are header-only and were previously vendored as git submodules under external/.
# We fetch them here instead so:
#   * the patched websocketpp copy lives in the build dir (build/_deps), never
#     dirtying a tracked worktree the way an in-place `git apply` on a submodule did;
#   * the local fixes are a normal PATCH_COMMAND against the pinned tag, applied once
#     at populate (no idempotent reverse-check dance);
#   * external/ holds only vcpkg.
#
# Pins are the exact commits the submodules recorded. asio/OpenSSL/ZLIB/json come
# from vcpkg (find_package in src/mth), not from here.
#
# Exposes: mthap::apclient (INTERFACE, system include dirs only).
