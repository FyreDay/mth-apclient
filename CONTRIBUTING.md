# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in mth-apclient. This document covers building, testing, and the
conventions the project follows.

## Prerequisites

- CMake >= 3.25, Ninja, and a C++23 compiler (the presets use `clang`/`clang++` (`clang-cl` / `clang++-cl` on Windows)).
- Dependencies are pulled automatically:
  - **vcpkg**: the only git submodule (`external/vcpkg`). It provides nlohmann-json, the
    networking deps (asio, OpenSSL, zlib), and, on Linux only, the overlay deps (Vulkan headers,
    SDL2 headers). The Windows overlay needs no vcpkg packages: its Dear ImGui backends build
    against the D3D12/Win32 headers the platform SDK already ships.
  - **Dear ImGui** (overlay), **Frida-Gum** (Linux hook backend), **MinHook** (Windows hook
    backend), **Catch2** (tests), and the Archipelago client headers (apclientpp / wswrap /
    websocketpp) are fetched at configure time via CMake `FetchContent`.

## Getting the source

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Axertin/mth-apclient
cd mth-apclient
# if you forgot --recurse-submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building

The project is preset-driven. Presets are compiler-led, so `cmake --list-presets` shows only the
ones valid for your host.

### Linux mod (`mod.so`)

```bash
cmake --preset clang-x64-debug      # or clang-x64-release
cmake --build --preset clang-x64-debug
```

### Tests only (fastest loop)

The unit tests skip the module and the hook backends, so this needs none of the game-adjacent
dependencies. They do compile in a couple of Linux PAL sources, so the test lane is Linux-only:

```bash
cmake --preset clang-x64-tests
cmake --build --preset clang-x64-tests
ctest --preset clang-x64-tests --output-on-failure
```

### Windows mod (`mod.dll`)

The canonical Windows build uses native `clang-cl` with a static CRT (run on Windows or CI):

```bash
cmake --preset clang-cl-x64-release
cmake --build --preset clang-cl-x64-release
```

A LLVM-MinGW cross preset (`mingw-x64-debug`) is available for a fast Windows compile-check from a
Linux box. It is a development aid only. It produces a MinGW-ABI binary, not a shippable artifact.

## Testing the Linux build

Copy `build/clang-x64-debug/mods/apclient/` (`mod.so` and `mod.yc`) into the game's mods
directory at `~/.local/share/Yacht Club Games/Mina the Hollower/mods/apclient/` (the SDL pref
path, not the install dir). Launch via Steam with the `-mod -mod-allow-code` options. The game loader
writes `~/.local/share/Yacht Club Games/Mina the Hollower/mod.log` with load diagnostics. The
mod's own runtime log is `~/.local/share/mth-apclient/mthap_*.log`.

## Reading a crash report

The mod logs a backtrace on a fatal signal (Linux) or an unhandled exception (Windows), appended to the runtime log above. Windows also writes a minidump next to it. Release builds carry their own debug info, so there is no separate symbol file to match up.

Windows frames come out already named: `mod.pdb` ships beside `mod.dll`, and the handler resolves them in-process.

Linux frames are raw `module(+0xRVA)`, because the handler has to stay async-signal-safe. Resolve them afterwards with `addr2line`, which reads the compressed DWARF in `mod.so` directly:

```bash
# one frame; the offset is the value in the parentheses
addr2line -e mods/apclient/mod.so -f -C 0x4a1c0

# every mod frame in a reported log
grep -o 'mod\.so(+0x[0-9a-f]*' report.log | cut -d+ -f2 |
    addr2line -e mods/apclient/mod.so -f -C
```

Use the `mod.so` from the release the reporter was running, or the offsets land on the wrong lines. The version is in the startup log and the release asset's filename. Game frames resolve the same way against the Linux game binary, which is unstripped.

## Formatting

Formatting is enforced (Allman style, `.clang-format`). Run it before committing:

```bash
bash format.sh
```

...or point git at the tracked hook once per clone, after which every commit is formatted:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

CI gates merges on formatting with a pinned clang-format version.

## Code layout & the platform boundary

The codebase is split into these targets (see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)):

- `mthap_core`: pure, cross-platform logic. **It must not include platform, OS, or hook-backend
  headers**, because the unit tests link it without the module or a backend. Portable third-party
  libraries are allowed provided they resolve with no vcpkg feature selected, since the tests lane
  requests none.
- `mthap_mod`: the wrapper over the game's own mod API, under `src/mod/`. Also test-linked.
- `mthap_net`: the Archipelago link, built only when networking is enabled.
- `mthap_pal`: the platform abstraction layer (process entry points and hook backend) under
  `src/pal/{linux,windows}/`.
- `mthap`: the final module that composes them.

When you add platform-specific behavior, put it behind a PAL interface rather than `#ifdef`-ing it
into the core or the higher-level logic.

See [docs/reverse-engineering.md](docs/reverse-engineering.md) for how game functions are
hooked and resolved on each platform. It covers the native mod hooks, the Frida/MinHook detour
seam, and the Windows signature-table workflow.

## Continuous integration

Pull requests run a formatting check, the Linux unit tests, and the Linux and Windows mod builds.
Keep them green. Tagged releases (`v*` on `master`) build and publish artifacts automatically.

## Commit conventions

- The PR title must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
  since it becomes the squash-merge subject and release-please reads it for the changelog. Types:
  `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `chore`. No scope in
  parentheses.
- Commits inside a branch are free to say whatever describes them. Only the title is parsed.
- Keep commit bodies short and to the point.
- Keep history linear and rebase-friendly.
